# SONG: Self Organizing Nebulous Growths

## What's about
- Self Organizing Nebulous Growths (SONG) is a dimension reduction technique that can be used for data visualization similarliy to t-SNE.
- SONG has an advantage in incremental data visualization. In other words, when new data is added, SONG need not re-initialize the internal parameter.
- This implementation is based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04896 
- I am not related to the authors of the paper.

A sample generated by SONG via 3-class MNIST dataset.

## How to Use
- This project is work in progress...
- Even a demo doesn't work properly, but if you try the demo,
```
$ python mnist_trial.py
```
